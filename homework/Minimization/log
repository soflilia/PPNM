OPG A...

Computing minima at start point = (2,3)...
Rosenbrucks function: n = 15 iterations, value = 1.06067500736637E-11
(x,y) = (1.00000249914903,1.00000478947414)
Himmelblau function: n = 6 iterations, value = 3.2032178001078E-13
(x,y) = (2.9999999021735,2.0000000211443)


OPG B...

My values for the Breit Wigner fit are: n = 14 iterations, value = 26.8695117788866
and the params are m= 125.972183995321, gamma= 2.08633190463958 A = 9.87621961682271


OPG C... NOW WITH CENTRAL DIFFERENTIATION

Computing minima at start point = (2,3)...
Rosenbrocks central:
Rosenbrucks function: n = 14 iterations, value = 6.38859497101779E-13
(x,y) = (1.00000079731643,1.00000158902458)
central: 4.7133 ms 
forward: 20.6179 ms 
Himmelblau central:
Himmelblau function: n = 6 iterations, value = 1.75141858859541E-15
(x,y) = (2.99999999750608,2.00000001103989)
central: 0.075 ms 
forward: 0.1634 ms 


Conclusion...
it seems central derivative method is slightly better, because the resulting minima are smaller and thus
the found values (x,y) must be equaly closer to the true value. We also have a time difference in favour
of the central algorithm implementation.
